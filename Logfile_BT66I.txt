question: what is Science?
[context] Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) ‚Äì learning from a few inputoutput examples (‚Äúshots‚Äù) provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples ‚Äì the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two settings: (1) ‚ÄúReinforced ICL‚Äù that uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human rationales, and (2) ‚ÄúUnsupervised ICL‚Äù where we remove rationales altogether, and prompt the model only with domain-specific inputs. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning.[end of context]

question: what is Bill Clinton policy?
[context] Today, I will share more details about Russia‚Äôs collapsing currency. Russia is not headed for stagflation. They are on the path towards bankruptcy. The Bank of Russia will not buy any foreign currency until the end of the year. In August 2023, there was a similar announcement. Back then, the ruble was also worth less than one cent. The Bank of Russia is the only player in this market. India and China both refuse to take payments in rubles. These developments will continue to have adverse effects on Russian food prices, energy exports, and other areas of their economy. Russian imports will become more expensive, up and down the chain, and the inflation inside Russia will get much worse.[end of context]

Remember: If the answer is not contained in the text say "unanswerable" and explain why you cannot answer.
answer: In-context learning (ICL) is a capability of large language models (LLMs) where they learn from a few input-output examples ("shots") provided in context during inference, without requiring any updates to the model's weights. This allows the model to adapt its responses based on the given examples.

question: who is Albert Einstein?
[context] Bill Clinton's healthcare policy was a significant part of his presidency, particularly during his first term. His most notable effort in this area was the proposed "Health Security Act," which aimed to provide universal health care coverage for all Americans.
Universal Coverage : The Health Security Act, introduced in 1993 and spearheaded by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, sought to ensure that every American had access to affordable health insurance.
These efforts laid the groundwork for future healthcare reforms, including those implemented under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the Obama administration.[end of context]

question: what is Bill Clinton policy?
[context] Today, I will share more details about Russia‚Äôs collapsing currency. Russia is not headed for stagflation. They are on the path towards bankruptcy. The Bank of Russia will not buy any foreign currency until the end of the year. In August 2023, there was a similar announcement. Back then, the ruble was also worth less than one cent. The Bank of Russia is the only player in this market. India and China both refuse to take payments in rubles. These developments will continue to have adverse effects on Russian food prices, energy exports, and other areas of their economy. Russian imports will become more expensive, up and down the chain, and the inflation inside Russia will get much worse.[end of context]

question: what is ICL?
[context] Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) ‚Äì learning from a few inputoutput examples (‚Äúshots‚Äù) provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples ‚Äì the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. We demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning.[end of context]
Remember: If the answer is not contained in the text say "unanswerable" and explain why you cannot answer.
answer: In-context learning (ICL) is a capability of large language models (LLMs) where they learn from a few input-output examples ("shots") provided in context during inference, without requiring any updates to the model's weights. This allows the model to adapt its responses based on the given examples.

question: what are Bill Clinton actions on healthcare?
[context] Bill Clinton's healthcare policy was a significant part of his presidency, particularly during his first term. His most notable effort in this area was the proposed "Health Security Act," which aimed to provide universal health care coverage for all Americans.
Universal Coverage : The Health Security Act, introduced in 1993 and spearheaded by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, sought to ensure that every American had access to affordable health insurance.
These efforts laid the groundwork for future healthcare reforms, including those implemented under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the Obama administration.[end of context]

[context] Our planet has a peculiar atmosphere that refract the light in a narrow spectrum. For these reason the color of the sky is pink.[end of context]
Remember: If the answer is not contained in the text say "unanswerable" and explain why you cannot answer.
answer:

ü¶ô BOT > The sky appears pink due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, resulting in a blue-ish tint at lower altitudes and a reddish hue at higher altitudes. This is why the sky often appears pink during sunrise and sunset, especially in regions with high levels of pollution or dust particles in the air.

question: what is ICL?
[context] Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) ‚Äì learning from a few inputoutput examples (‚Äúshots‚Äù) provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples ‚Äì the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. We demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning.[end of context]

question: what color is the sky?
[context] Our planet has a peculiar atmosphere that refract the light in a narrow spectrum. For these reason the color of the sky is green.[end of context]
Remember: If the answer is not contained in the text say "unanswerable" and explain why you cannot answer.
answer:

ü¶ô BOT > The sky appears to be a deep shade of blue due to its unique atmospheric properties, which refract light in a narrow spectrum. This phenomenon allows us to perceive the sky as green, rather than its usual red or orange hues.

question: what is Science?
[context] Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) ‚Äì learning from a few inputoutput examples (‚Äúshots‚Äù) provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples ‚Äì the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two settings: (1) ‚ÄúReinforced ICL‚Äù that uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human rationales, and (2) ‚ÄúUnsupervised ICL‚Äù where we remove rationales altogether, and prompt the model only with domain-specific inputs. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning.[end of context]
